# Data-Driven Development with Python
* Created a highly interactive website with streamlit that accepts all file types
* showed basic statistical measures, implemented an interactive world map to present data related to location, selectable X & Y axis scatter plot, and interactive pie chart
* Cleaned and manipulated data with pandas to get desired information, and analyzed data through writing 200+ lines of codes
* Can check out other personal projects under assignment folder to better understand my coding skills

Note: Due to project upload requirement for the class, Github has trouble dealing with the file_uploader() in streamlit, so the project is link was changed to relaxing the specific file directly
